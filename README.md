# outlookfun
This is a PowerShell script that allows you to send 2 pre-formatted emails in rapid succession to save time. In this case, these emails send a new user a user ID in one email, and a password and a unique identifier in another.
All the person running the script has to do is input the user's email address twice in order to confirm the correct address, add some more information and its done.
In order to run this, you have to copt the PowerShell script to your desktop, right-click, and select "Run with PowerShell". If your execution policy is set to "Restricted" it probably will not run.
Please do research on how to change this to RemoteSigned or Unrestricted at your own risk.
